/* Input Args:

 *   destbuf -- Pointer to a character array where all read characters will be read.
 *              The buffer will be null-terminated regardless of the number of
 *              characters successfully read (even if 0).
 *   bufsz -- The size of the buffer that 'destbuf' points to.
 * Returns:
 *   Function returns the number of characters successfully read PLUS one.  So if
 *   an empty line is read, 1 is returned.  Function returns 0 if an EOF condition
 *   is detected.  Otherwise, it returns -1 if an error condition is encountered.
