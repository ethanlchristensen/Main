This Project was made to emulate a shell on a unix like machine. Hence, this can only be used on a unix-based machine.

After downloading the file to ones machine if can be complied with 
```gcc -o shell shell.c```
And then ran with 
```./shell```
Where you will then be able to enter simple external shell commands, such as 
```date```, ```cal```,and ```echo```
Thankyou :o)
